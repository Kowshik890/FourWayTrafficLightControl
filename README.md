# Four Way Traffic Light Control
### This project was developed for Microprocessor and Microcontroller course in Bachelor program.
**The aim of the project is to implement a simple traffic light controller system using Arduino UNO, where the traffic is controlled in a pre-defined timing system.**
**This simple four way traffic light circuit has two stage one is timing & counting stage another one is Indication lights stage.**
