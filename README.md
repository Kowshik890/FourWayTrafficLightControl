# Four Way Traffic Light Control
### This project was developed for Microprocessor and Microcontroller course in Bachelor program.
**The aim of the project is to implement a simple traffic light controll system using Arduino UNO, where the traffic is controlled in a pre-defined timing system.**
**This system has two stage. One is timing & counting stage (how many time to wait) another one is Indication lights stage (which colored LEDs should turn on or off).**
